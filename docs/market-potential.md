# MARKET POTENTIAL

The global cryptocurrency market, with its current valuation surpassing USD 1.2 trillion, stands as a testament to the transformative power of digital currencies. This includes popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and others, as well as thousands of smaller altcoins and tokens. With a projected growth rate of 30-50% CAGR over the next 5 years, the market is poised to reach unprecedented heights, potentially exceeding USD 3.7 - 7.5 trillion by 2028.

The forecast underscores the immense potential for further expansion and adoption of digital currencies globally. Despite this exponential surge, cryptocurrency ownership remains confined to a fraction of the world's population, with only 10.7% currently holding digital assetsâ€”a figure expected to marginally rise to 12.4% by 2028.

These factors could include greater awareness and education about cryptocurrencies, improvements in user interfaces and accessibility of cryptocurrency platforms, increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and technological advancements in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
